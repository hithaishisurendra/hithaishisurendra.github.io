      <h2>Welcome to the world of Formula 1, where engineering brilliance meets raw adrenaline.</h2>
      <p>Since its first championship race in 1950, Formula 1 has grown into a global spectacle, combining high-speed action with
      relentless innovation. What once began with stripped-down cars and limited safety has transformed into a sport defined
      by data, design, and milliseconds. Every turn, pit stop, and overtaking move is backed by a symphony of mechanics,
      aerodynamics, and strategy.</p>
      <p>
      At its core, F1 is a constant battle for marginal gains where engineers, teams, and drivers work in unison to shave off
      just a fraction of a second. Behind the roar of the engines and the flash of carbon fiber lies a delicate balance
      between power, grip, weight, and resilience. These machines are built not only to go fast but to survive the intense
      pressures of racing at over 300 km/h, often within centimeters of another car or a concrete barrier.</p>
      <p>
      This journey takes you through the evolution of the sport, one checkpoint at a time. You'll uncover how technology,
      safety, and performance have shaped the cars and the competition. To begin, let’s zoom in on the modern F1 car itself -
      a marvel of design where every component serves a purpose. Tap on different parts of the car to learn how they work
      together to create one of the most advanced vehicles on the planet.

       <h2>Who’s Built the Fastest Legacy?</h2>
      <p>Now that you've seen what makes up a modern F1 car, it’s time to shift focus from machine to team. While every car is a
      marvel of engineering, the story of Formula 1 is also a story of fierce rivalries, dominant eras, and shifting momentum
      between legendary constructors. From Ferrari’s historic legacy to Mercedes’ hybrid-era dominance and Red Bull’s recent
      resurgence, each season brings new drama to the points table.</p>
      <In>Scroll down for a bump chart revealing how team
      rankings have shifted in the last ten seasons, then dynamic bar-chart race of championship wins over the decades. Let’s explore
      how strategy, consistency, and innovation shape not just races, but legacies.

      <h2>Which Racing Legends Own the Record Books?</h2> 
      <p>While teams battle for constructor titles, it’s the drivers who truly capture the hearts of fans and leave lasting
      legacies. Behind every dominant car is a racer who knows when to take risks, defend aggressively, or deliver under
      pressure. Formula 1 history is filled with legendary names — each representing a unique era of excellence, rivalry, and
      determination.</p>
      <p>
      Here, we shift the spotlight to the drivers who defined the sport. This interactive bubble chart
      showcases individual success in terms of race wins and world championships. You'll see titans like Michael Schumacher,
      whose relentless dominance shaped the early 2000s, Lewis Hamilton, who redefined consistency in the hybrid era, and
      Sebastian Vettel, who rose rapidly to capture four consecutive titles. And of course, modern stars like Max Verstappen,
      whose aggressive style and raw pace are writing the next chapter of F1 history.
      Each bubble tells a story — of victories earned, rivalries fought, and the pursuit of greatness at over 300 km/h. </p>
      <p> As you scroll, you'll see the multi-world-championship title-winning drivers of Formula 1 over time, segmented by key
      technical eras: Pre-War Influence, Cosworth DFV, Turbo, V10, and Hybrid. The dominance of the best in the world over different eras!

      <h2>How Teams Master the Pit Lane</h2>
      <p>
        Every second in the pit lane can swing a race result. From early stops of over 60 seconds to today’s
        lightning-quick sub-two-second changes, pit crews have turned a necessary pause into a strategic advantage.

      <h2>How Tragedy Fueled Innovation</h2> 
      <p>But success in Formula 1 doesn’t come without risk. For all its glamour and glory, the sport has always carried an
      element of danger. Every driver who lines up on the grid understands the fine line between control and catastrophe. Over
      the decades, tragic accidents have served as harsh reminders of that reality — prompting the sport to evolve not just in
      speed, but in safety.</p>
      <p>
    Behind every safety breakthrough lies a hard lesson learned at full speed. When disaster struck, engineers rewrote the
    rules—introducing helmets, crash structures, and the famous halo. This chart shows how each spike in incidents sparked
    the next leap in driver protection.

       <h2>The World Tour of F1: Mapping a Global Championship</h2> 
      <p>As the sport has grown safer, it has also grown bigger — both in scale and global reach. What began as a handful of
      European races has expanded into a globe-trotting championship that spans five continents and some of the most iconic
      circuits in motorsport. Today, Formula 1 isn’t just a racing series — it’s a worldwide tour of speed, culture, and
      engineering excellence.</p>
      <p>
      In the next visualization, you’ll explore the 2024 F1 season from a global perspective. This interactive world map
      traces the full calendar, mapping each Grand Prix in the order it appears throughout the year. Follow the journey from
      the desert heat of Bahrain to the neon streets of Las Vegas, and discover just how many kilometers the sport travels in
      a single season. It’s a striking look at the logistical scale — and the global fandom — that powers modern Formula 1.
